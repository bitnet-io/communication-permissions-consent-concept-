# communication-permissions-consent-concept-



cell communication between two people have to ask for an auth pin from the person to screenshot data 

think telegram 
Twitter 
discord 


consent between two people that one of them can screenshot the other person conversation with text communication 

 

 also pin consent to share a photo that once someone sends a photo it can't retransmit without a pin consent to allow the other person to transmit

 and maybe also a pin consent has to happen before someone can send someone a link


can I send you a link? what is your consent pin


do you want to send me that link? hold on I'll give you the pin auth that allows you to send me a link


think 2fa pin between two people


or a channel 2fa pin



think robinhood block screenshot (but this would work if the pin had a consent with two people talking in private message)
